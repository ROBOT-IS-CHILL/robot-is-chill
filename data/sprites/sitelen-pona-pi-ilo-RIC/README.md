## Info on variants

Some (hopefully eventually most) glyphs have `_stack`, `_small` and/or `_outer` variants.

- `_stack` sprites can be used to stack two glyphs on top of each other.
- `_small` sprites have a total size of 7×7 maximum. They can also be used in a stack.
- `_outer` sprites are adjusted to have consistent, more-or-less 7×7 gaps so that small sprites can fit in them to create nested glyphs.
