If you try to render a text object that doesn't exist (for example, `text_kekek`), the bot will try to generate the text!
Text is generated by slicing up known sprites into letters, and pasting them as a font.
The text automatically splits in the middle into top and bottom sections if it goes over three characters long. This can be turned off with the `:oneline` variant.
Text can be manually split using `/`. So, 
```
abc/d -> ABC
          D
ab/cd -> A B
         C D
a/bcd ->  A
         BCD
```
Text can also be split more than once! This works about how you'd expect.

If you want to put a space, either use a `~` or escape it with `\`. That is, you can type `A~B/C~D`, or `A\ B/C\ D`. 

SPOILERS: ||If you want letter-like text, like AB or KE, you can use the `:letter` variant on text to do that.||
