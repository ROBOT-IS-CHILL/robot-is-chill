Nimi's Garden (Deluxe!)



Disclaimer: 

If you have a playthrough of Nimi's Garden in progress, your save data
will NOT carry over (and if it does, I highly suggest deleting it because existing
save data could cause major problems).

The good news:

If you want to extremely quickly regain your progress, you can enable debug mode and
"ctrl+m" your way through the levels you've already beaten.

	To enable debug mode, find your Baba is You save data (if on Windows,
	most likely in %appdata%), open settings.txt, and set debug to
	"debug=1" under the [settings] category.
	Once you've done this, you can press "ctrl" and "m" at the same
	time to instantly win a level!

Also, there are spoilers for late-game stuff near the bottom of this document.
Read beyond the general changes section at your own risk!
